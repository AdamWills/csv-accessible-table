CSV to Accessible Tables
========================

Need a tool for users to quickly create acessible tables from a spreadsheet? Then you've come to the right place.

How it works
-------------

A user simply pastes the contents of their CSV file into a textbox, review a few options on how their table is structured, then with the click of a button, HTML is generated.

Options
--------
What options are there?

* Does the first row contain headings?
* Does the first column contain headings?
* Is the last row a footer?
* Does your table need a caption?

Additional Info
---------------
This tools uses [jquery-csv](https://code.google.com/p/jquery-csv/) to convert the csv to an array - so thanks to the folks to have contributed to that project.
